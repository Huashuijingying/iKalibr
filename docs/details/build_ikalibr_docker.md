This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the `iKalibr` project in a Docker environment, including building and compiling it. Please follow the steps below.

## Steps

### 1. Install Docker

If you haven't installed Docker yet, please do so first. Choose the appropriate installation method for your operating system ([Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)).

### 2. Pull Docker Image

Once Docker is installed, pull the latest `ulong2/ie_kalibr_image:latest` image from Docker Hub (see [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ulong2/ie_kalibr_image/general)) by running the following command:

```bash
docker pull ulong2/ie_kalibr_image:latest
```

### 3. Build the Container

After pulling the image, build the Docker container. You can customize the container name by replacing `your_container_name` with your preferred name. For example:

```
docker run -it --name your_container_name ulong2/ie_kalibr_image:latest bash
```

This command will start the container with your custom name (`your_container_name`) and open a terminal window inside it.

### 4. Enter the Container and Pull the Latest Code

Inside the container, navigate to the `/home/iKalibr/src/ikalibr` directory:

```
cd /home/iKalibr/src/ikalibr
```

Then, pull the latest version of the `iKalibr` using `Git`:

```
git pull
```

### 5. Build Third-Party Dependencies

Once the latest code is pulled, run the following commands to build third-party dependencies:

```
chmod +x build_thirdparty.sh
./build_thirdparty.sh
```

### 6. Compile the Project

Next, you need to compile the project. First, navigate to the parent directory:

```
cd ../..
```

Then, run the following command to generate messages:

```
catkin_make ikalibr_generate_messages
```

Finally, run the command below to compile the entire project:

```
catkin_make -j8 -DUSE_CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD=ON
```

Note: The `-j8` option uses 8 threads for parallel compilation. You can adjust this depending on your machine's configuration.

### 7. Done

Once the compilation is complete, the `iKalibr` project is ready to use.
